]- 👋 Hi, I’m @robwilkens
- 👀 I’m interested in Good Food, Relaxing, Vacations...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning not to be so serious...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that I could potentially have a use for myself, if it's something i could potentially use, I'd like to help make it better.  That would help me and others who would use it.
- 📫 How to reach me ... robwilkens@hotmail.com - but expect to wind up in my junkmail folder if you e-mail me, I have a mailbox where I whitelist addresses I trust
