]- 👋 Hi, I’m @robwilkens
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Development in general, I've worked in operating systems (kernls/libraries/commands), I've created and sold Windows programs, I've created Apps for Windows 8 App Store and Android from scratch, I've built PHP-based websites and web services.  I've created Android and IOS apps.  I don't yet have much experience with Python or self-learning systems (AI, etc.), but I'm looking into some of that as time and resources allow. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [deleted..to be replaced]
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that I could potentially have a use for myself, if it's something i could potentially use, I'd like to help make it better.  That would help me and others who would use it.
